habitrpg-arachnophobia
====================

Chrome extension to squish all the spiders (and rats) on HabitRPG so that people don't need to see them. 

To install, simply [download the .crx](https://github.com/tjwds/habitrpg-arachnophobia/raw/master/habitrpg-arachnophobia.crx) and drag and drop it into your extensions in Chrome.  Simple, huh?

At some point, the ability to toggle between which animals you don't want to see will be added, and at a more distant point, hopefully this functionality will be integrated into the functionality of the site itself.  Alas, I am a graduate student, so these things will be a little while.
