habitrpg-arachnophobia
====================

Chrome extension to squish all the spiders (and rats) on HabitRPG so that people don't need to see them. 

To install, simply enable Developer Mode on your extensions page in Chrome (it's a checkbox near the top), then [download the .crx](https://github.com/tjwds/habitrpg-arachnophobia/raw/master/habitrpg-arachnophobia.crx) and drag and drop it into that page.   Simple, huh?

Note:  Don't try to double-click the .crx or just run it in some other wayâ€”Chrome prevents its users from being able to run extensions that way so that malicious people won't be able to install stuff on your computer willy-nilly. 

**Windows Users:**  Chrome for Windows means you have one extra added step:  [see here for a full explanation.](http://www.ghacks.net/2014/02/14/resolve-chromes-suspicious-extensions-disabled-notification/). 

At some point, the ability to toggle between which animals you don't want to see will be added, and at a more distant point, hopefully this functionality will be integrated into the functionality of the site itself.  Alas, I am a graduate student, so these things will be a little while.
